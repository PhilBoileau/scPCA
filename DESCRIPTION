Description: A toolbox for sparse contrastive principal component analysis
    (scPCA) of high-dimensional biological data. scPCA combines the stability of
    sparse PCA with the interpretability afforded by contrastive PCA's approach
    of comparing the target data set to a background data set, allowing for
    the biological variation of interest in a data set to be recovered.
