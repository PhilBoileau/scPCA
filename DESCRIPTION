Description: This package contains the necessary tools to perform the sparse
    contrastive principal component analysis (scPCA) of high-dimensional data.
    scPCA combines the interpretability and stability of penalized PCA with the
    ability of contrastive PCA to create low-dimensional representations of data
    that summarize the high-dimensional structure of interest.
