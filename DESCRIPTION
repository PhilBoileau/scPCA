Description: This package contains the necessary tools to perform sparse
    contrastive principal component analysis (scPCA) of high-dimensional data.
    scPCA combines the interpretability and stability of sparse PCA with the
    ability of contrastive PCA to capture the variation of interest in a data
    set.
