Description: This package contains the necessary tools to perform the sparse
             contrastive principal component analysis (scPCA) of 
             high-dimensional data. scPCA combines the interpretability and
             stability of penalized PCA with the contrastive PCA's ability to
             create low-dimensional representations of data that summarize
             high-dimensional structure of interest.
